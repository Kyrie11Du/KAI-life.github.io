## Introduction
### research background 
- 
### Research Purpose
- Subject of study are 4 coacervates below
>  To ensure representative coacervate systems, we selected commonly studied PArg/PAsp coacervates driven by electrostatic interactions, rmfp-1 coacervates driven by cation−π interactions, small molecule coacervates conforming to the sticker-and-spacer model, and HBpeps coacervate systems driven by various interactions. 
- vertify the performance of Martini force field + elucidate the stability mechanisms of those coacevates 
> We conducted independent simulations of these systems using the latest Martini version 3.0 of the force field. This review not only aims to reproduce experimental phenomena using Martini 3.0 but also aims to elucidate the stability mechanisms of coacervates and benchmark Martini 3.0 through these simulations.
### Research Methods
