### SC‘s Current Density-Voltage Characteristics Analysis
>" A step by step approach to analyse SCs and indentify performance-limiting factors through the analysis of J-V curves"
-  Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE)
> $$PCE = Pout/Pin = Jsc · Voc · FF/ Pin$$
> Pin being the incident light power 
- Open-circuit Voltage (Voc)
>"The voltage at which the net current through the cell is zero"
- Short-circuit Current density (Jsc)
>"Current Density at which the outer cell voltage is zero"
- Fill Factor (FF) 
> $$FF = /frac{Jmpp·Vmpp}{Jsc·Voc}$$
>Jmpp and Vmpp denote the current density and voltagr at the maximum power point (MPP) respectively.
